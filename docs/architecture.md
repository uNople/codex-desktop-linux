# Architecture

This repository adapts the upstream macOS ChatGPT Desktop DMG into Linux app and
package artifacts.

## Build Pipeline

1. `install.sh` extracts `Codex.dmg` with `7z` / `7zz`.
2. It detects the Electron version from upstream metadata, with a pinned
   fallback.
3. It extracts and patches `app.asar` with fail-soft Linux compatibility
   patches.
4. It rebuilds native Node modules such as `better-sqlite3` and `node-pty` for
   Linux through `@electron/rebuild`.
5. It downloads a matching Linux Electron runtime.
6. It stages bundled plugins and any enabled optional `linux-features/`.
7. It writes the Linux launcher to `codex-app/start.sh` from
   `launcher/start.sh.template`.
8. Package builders repackage `codex-app/` into `.deb`, `.rpm`,
   `.pkg.tar.zst`, or AppImage artifacts.
9. Default native packages install `codex-update-manager` and a
   `systemd --user` service.

The installer replaces the macOS Electron binary with a Linux build, recompiles
native modules, and removes macOS-only pieces such as Sparkle.

## Patch System

Core Linux compatibility patches live under `scripts/patches/core/`.
Descriptors declare phase, order, target filters, and CI policy.

`scripts/patch-linux-window-ui.js` is the build-facing CLI only. It parses
arguments, creates/writes the optional report, calls
`scripts/patches/runner.js`, and applies the critical gate after the report is
written. Internal code imports runner APIs, not the CLI file.

`scripts/patches/runner.js` collects core descriptors plus enabled
`linux-features/` descriptors and executes the fresh-DMG pipeline:

1. `main-bundle`
2. `extracted-app:pre-webview`
3. `webview-asset`
4. `extracted-app:post-webview`

`scripts/patches/engine.js` owns descriptor normalization, target/enabled
checks, phase execution, warning capture, and status recording. Shared
implementation code lives under `scripts/patches/impl/` by domain; generic
helpers live under `scripts/patches/lib/`. The deleted compatibility barrels
are intentionally not part of the architecture.

`ciPolicy` is the ordinary descriptor criticality axis, enforced by the patch
engine — patches themselves never abort the build:

- `required-upstream` (critical): the app does not launch or is core-unusable
  without it. If one fails (no match or a throw), the patcher exits non-zero
  with an aggregated `Critical patch failures` summary and the build aborts.
  `CODEX_ENFORCE_CRITICAL_PATCHES=0` bypasses this for emergency builds.
- `optional`: best-effort. Failures and throws are caught by the engine,
  logged as warnings, and listed in the end-of-build
  `optional patches not fully applied` summary so they can be fixed later.
- `opt-in`: disabled unless explicitly enabled; recorded as `skipped-disabled`.

Integrity failures are the deliberate global exception to `ciPolicy`. A
descriptor that throws `PatchIntegrityError` is recorded as
`failed-integrity` and always fails candidate acceptance, even when the
descriptor is optional. This status means a transactional mutation failed and
could not prove that rollback restored the original bytes.

Every build writes a patch report (`<app>/.codex-linux/patch-report.json`,
next to `build-info.json`). `scripts/lib/patch-report.js` owns report statuses
and failure predicates. CI validates the same report with
`scripts/ci/validate-patch-report.js`, which shares the failure predicate with
the local gate and prints non-failing optional-drift warnings.

Optional additions belong under `linux-features/`. Feature patching uses only
`entrypoints.patchDescriptors`; feature descriptor ids are namespaced in patch
reports and are optional by default.

## Launcher

The launcher serves extracted webview assets from `content/webview/` on
`127.0.0.1` (`5175` by default, `5176` for the dev app), validates the origin,
then starts Electron.

Warm-start launches hand off actions such as `--new-chat` over a Unix-domain
socket instead of spawning a second app process.

Native-package-only launcher behavior, such as desktop-entry hints and default
update-manager startup, lives in:

```text
packaging/linux/codex-packaged-runtime.sh
```

The current evaluation for a future Rust replacement of the local webview
server lives in [webview-server-evaluation.md](webview-server-evaluation.md).

## Bundled Plugins

The build preserves portable upstream Sites, Deep Research, and Visualize
plugins when they are listed in the official DMG marketplace. Their payloads
must match the expected local path and contain no symlinks, privileged entries,
native executables, or platform-specific bundles. Availability in the app can
still depend on upstream account entitlements or rollout gates.

Plugins with native macOS payloads are not copied through this portable path.
Linux Computer Use and opt-in Record and Replay use repository-owned Linux
replacements instead. The bundled LaTeX plugin remains excluded until its
Tectonic runtime has a verified Linux staging path.

### Chrome Plugin

The build stages the upstream Chrome plugin, patches its Linux compatibility
paths, builds the native messaging host from Rust, and installs browser
manifests for Chrome, Brave, and Chromium.
